# Shadyproject Layout

A constantly tweaked work in progress.
No RGB controls, because I don't have it set up (yet)

* Largely standard QWERTY layout for the primary layer.
* Programming punctuation in the second layer, along with backlight controls activated by left hand cluster.
* Media control and arrow key navigation on the third layer, activated by right hand cluster.
